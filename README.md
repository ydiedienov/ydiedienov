# Hello, I'm Yurii, Frontend Developer :v:

My name is **Yurii Diedienov**, I’m 23 years old. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science, which helped me develop a strong mathematical and analytical mindset. I’m a junior frontend developer with a keen eye for detail—an essential trait for building clean, user-friendly interfaces. I primarily work with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I’m actively expanding my knowledge of modern frameworks and frontend technologies. I'm a fast learner, team-oriented, and persistent when tackling complex tasks. My goal is to join a professional environment where I can apply my skills, gain hands-on experience, and contribute to the development of modern web applications. I’m always open to learning, improving, and embracing new challenges in the ever-evolving world of frontend development.
